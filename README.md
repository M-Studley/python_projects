# Python Projects

Here will be all of my previous projects that I have completed and current ones I am working on now.
I am in the process of teaching myself with the help of some friends guiding me along the way.
As of today, February 2, 2024, I am getting started with GIT (again) and have already made some projects before this date that I will be pushing to this repository.
My intentions for this repository will be to track my progress, share my journey and allow a place for my friends and mentor to view what I have done this far.
The current project I am working on is a Blackjack game that is played in the terminal.  I have gone through many versions already and bear with my process.
My mentor has shown me the world of Classes and now I am re-writing the game with the goal of completing the project.
The Blackjack game will be, hopefully, as functional as a regular casino version of the game.

Thank you for reading this file and feel free to reach out to me at anytime here on GitHub.
